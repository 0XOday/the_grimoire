When Windows detects a problem, it will usually generate an error message. This makes troubleshooting simpler as you may only need to find out what the error message means using the Microsoft Knowledge Base ([support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com/)) or third-party support sites and forums.

The **Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc)** is a management console snap-in for viewing and managing logs on a Windows host. The default page shows a summary of system status, with recent errors and warning events collected for viewing. The left-hand pane groups log files into different categories.

With a log file selected, the three-part middle pane lets you see the details of the selected event without having to open a separate dialog. The third pane contains useful tools for opening log files, filtering, creating a task from an event, and so on.

### Default Log Files

The Windows Logs folder contains the four main log files:

- The System log contains information about events that affect the core OS. These include service load failures, hardware conflicts, driver load failures, network issues, and so on.
- The Application log contains information regarding non-core processes and utilities and some third-party apps. For example, app installers write events to the Application log.
- The Security log holds the audit data for the system.
- The Setup log records events generated during installation.

Each log file has a default maximum size (usually about 20 MB), but you can change this by selecting **Properties** on the appropriate log. This option also allows the overwrite option to be set either as overwrite, do not overwrite, or archive (close the current file and start a new one).

Be careful about preserving logs. Many computers have ample free disk space, but archive logs can grow very large if left unmonitored.

There are many other logs stored under the **Applications and Services Logs** node. You would investigate these when troubleshooting a particular Windows feature, service, or third-party application.

### Event Sources and Severity Levels

Each event is generated by a source application and allocated an ID and a severity level. The different event levels are as follows:

- **Critical**—An issue that should be treated as the highest priority in the context of the source application. Critical is often used to report a process that has halted or stopped responding.
- **Error**—A less severe issue that should be investigated once critical issues have been resolved.
- **Warning**—A state that could potentially lead to an error or critical condition if not remediated, such as the system running low on disk space.
- **Information**—Logs an operation or state that is noteworthy but does not require remediation.
- **Audit Success/Failure**—Events in the security log are classified as either successful, such as a user authenticating, or failed, such as a password not being entered correctly.

More information for each event can be displayed by double-clicking the event in question. This displays a screen that contains a full description of the event.
