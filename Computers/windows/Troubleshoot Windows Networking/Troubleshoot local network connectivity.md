If the link and IP configuration both seem to be correct, the problem may not lie with the local machine but somewhere in the overall network topology. You can test the connections to servers such as files shares, printers, or email by trying to use them. One drawback of this method is that there could be some sort of application fault rather than a networking fault. Therfore, it is useful to have a low-level test of basic connectivity that does not have any dependencies other than a working link and ip configuration.'

ping command response's 
* reply from senderIP Destination unreachable - if both hosts are supposed to be on the same network segment, this means that the sending hosts gets no response to ARP probes ARP is sued to locate the hardware or MAC address pf tje interface that owns an IP address. The most likely cause is that the destination host is disconnected or configured as non-discoverable. if you can confirm that the host is up this could indicate some sort of IP misconfiguration 
* Reply from gateway destination unreachable -- the gateway router has no forwarding information for that IP address. This indicates some misconfiguration of the router or destination network.
