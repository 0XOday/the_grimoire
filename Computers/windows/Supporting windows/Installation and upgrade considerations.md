Clean install or in-place upgrade
An attended installation is where the installer input the configuration information in response to prompts from a setup program. There are two main types of attended installation 

In-place upgrade means running setup from an existing version of the OS so that thrid-part applications, user settings, and data files are all kept and made available in the new version.

Clean installs are seen as more reliable than upgrading while in-place upgrades are designed for home users.

Note : Microsoft maintains a Windows logo'd Product List (LPL) formerly called the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) this is a catalog of tested devices and drivers.



Upgrade Considerations 

1. Check hardware compatibility - make sure the the cpu, shipset and RAM components of the computer are sufficient to run the OS. 
2. Check application and driver support/backward compatibility 
3. Backup files and user preferences - for a clean install, you can use a backup to restore data and settings after OS setup has been completed. For an in-place upgrade, a security backup is essential in case the upgrade goes wrong and you need to recover data
4. Obtain third-party drivers - the OS setup media might not contain drivers for certain hardware devices. This is typically only an issue where the computer uses a RAID controller. If the controller driver is not available, the setup program will not be able to use the RAID volume. You might also need to ensure that the driver for an ethernet or WI-FI adapter is available
