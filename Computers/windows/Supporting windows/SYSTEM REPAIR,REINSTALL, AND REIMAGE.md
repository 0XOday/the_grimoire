If System Restore or Startup Repair does not work and you cannot boot to a logon, you will have to use a system repair tool or possibly a reinstall option and restore from data backup. The various versions of Window use different system recovery tools and backup processes.

*Creating and Using a Recovery Image*
You can make a complete backup of the system configuration and data files as an *Image*. This requires a back device with sufficient capacity. The best compression ratio you can hope for is 2:1 - so a 20 GB system will create a 10 GB image - but if the system contains a lot of files that are already heavily compressed, the ratio could be a lot lower. You also have to keep the image up-to-date or make separate data backup 

You create a system image using the *Backup and Restore* applet in *Control Panel* Select the *Create a system image* link in the tasks pane.

To recover the system using the backup image, use the *Advanced Boot Option* or the *System image Recovery* option off a repair disk or recovery environment.

*Reinstalling windows*
If you do not have an up-to-date image, the last option is to reinstall Window using the *Reset this PC* option in the recovery environment.

Select *Keep my files* or *Remove everything* as appropriate. The *Keep my files* option can be used to repair the existing installation using either a local setup cache or by downloading the files from Microsoft's could servers. A reset recopies the system files and recovery's all PC settings to the default, but it can preserve user personalization settings, data files, and apps installed via Windows Store.
