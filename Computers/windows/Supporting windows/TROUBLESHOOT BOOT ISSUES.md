Assuming there is no underlying hardware issue, the general technique for troubleshooting *boot problems* is to determine the failure point, and therefore the missing or corrupt file. This can then be replaced either from the source files or by using some sort of recovery disk.

`bootrec /fixmbr` attempt repair of the MBR. Do not use this option if the disk uses GPT partitioning. 

`bootrec /` fixboot to attempt repair of the boot sector.

`bootrec /rebuildbcd` to add missing windows installations to the boot configuration database (BCD)

`diskpart` can also be used to ensure that the system partition is marked as active and that no other partitions have been marked as active

*Graphical Interface Fails to Load/Black Screen*
If windows appears to boot but does not display the sign-in screen or does not load the desktop following logon, the likely causes are corruption of drivers or other system files. if the system will boot to a GUI in Safe Mode, Then replace the graphics adaptive driver. if the system will not boot to a GUI at all, then the Windows installation will probably have to be repaired or recovered from backup. it is also possible that the boot configuration has been changed though `msconfig` and just needs to be set back.

Windows is also sporadically prone to black screen issues, where nothing appears on the screen. This will often occur during update installs, where the best course of action is to give the system time to complete the update. Look for signs of continuing disk activity and spinning dots appearing on the screen. if the system does not recover from a black screen, then try searching for any currently knows issues on support and troubleshooting sites. You can use the key seq WINDOWS+CTRL+SHIFT+B to test whether the system is responsive. there should be a beep and the display may reinitialize. 
if the problem occurs frequently, use `chkdsk` and `sfc` to verify system file integrity Also consider either an update or rollback of the graphics adapter driver
