Preforming an attended installation is time-consuming. Although the setup process has been streamlined since the early versions of Windows, an attended installation still requires the installer to monitor the setup program and input information. When it comes to large deployments there are several options for completing fully or
partially.

An unattended installation uses a script or configuration file to input the choices and settings that need to be made during setup. In Windows this is referred to as an answer file.
