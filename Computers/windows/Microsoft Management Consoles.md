Microsoft Management Consoles (MMCs) provide a standard interface for advanced configuration and management of Windows desktops and servers. You can use these consoles to manage security settings, set up scheduled tasks, and manage the disk subsystem. Additionally, when a configuration setting is not exposed in any of the normal GUI tools, you will need to use the Registry Editor to solve some types of issues.
