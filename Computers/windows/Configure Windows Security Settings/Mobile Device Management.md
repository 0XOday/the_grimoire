Mobile Device management is a class of software designed to apply security policies to the use of mobile devices in the enterprise. This software can be used to manage enterprise-owned devices as well as bring your own device.

The MDM software logs the use of a device on the network and determines whether to allow it to connect or not, based on admin-set parameters. When the device is enrolled with the management software, it can be configured with policies to allow or restrict use of apps, corporate data, and built-in functions, such as a video camera or microphone.
