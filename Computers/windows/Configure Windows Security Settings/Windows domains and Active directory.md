This model does not scale well to large numbers of users. Consequently, most business and educational organizations use Windows domain networks and accounts. A domain account can be authorized to access any computer joined to the domain. it can be assigned permissions on any resources hosted in the domain.

This database stores user, group and computer objects. this DC is responsible for providing an authentication service to users as they attempt to sign in.
