Windows authentication involves a complex architecture of components ([docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication)), but the following three scenarios are typical:
* Windows local sign-in - The Local Security Authority (LSA) compares the submitted credential to the one stored in the Security Accounts Manage (SAM) database, which is part of the registry. This is also referred to as interactive logon.
* Windows network sign-in : The LSA can pass credentials for authentication to a network service. The preferred system for network authentication is based on a system called Kerberos
