Settings and most Control Panel applets provide interfaces for managing basic desktop, device, and app configuration parameters. One of the options in Control Panel is the Administrative Tools shortcut. This links to a folder of shortcuts to several advanced configuration consoles.

A Microsoft Management Console (MMC) contains one or more snap-ins that are used to modify advanced settings for a subsystem, such as disks or users. The principal consoles available via Administrative Tools are:

- **Computer Management (compmgmt.msc)**—The default management console with multiple snap-ins to schedule tasks and configure local users and groups, disks, services, devices, and so on.
