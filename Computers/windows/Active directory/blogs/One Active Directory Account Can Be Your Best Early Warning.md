**tl;dr:** One AD account can provide you with three detections that if implemented properly will catch common adversarial activities early. Which detects?

- AD Enumeration via ADExplorer, BloodHound, and LDP.exe
- Kerberoasting and service principal attacks.
- Password sprays, credential stuffing, and brute-forcing.
