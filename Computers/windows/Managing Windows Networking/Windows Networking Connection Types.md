A computer joins a local network by connecting the networking adapter -- or networking interface card (NIC) -- to a switch or wireless access point. For proper end user device configuration, the card settings should be configured to match the capabilities of the network appliance.

*Establish a Wired Network Connection*
Almost all wired network connections are based on some type of Ethernet. The adapters media type must match that of the switch it is connected to. Most use copper wire cables with RJ45's jacks, Though installations in some corporate networks may use fiber optic cabling and connector types. The adapter and switch must also use the same Ethernet settings. These are usually set to auto negotiate, and a link will be established as soon as the cable is plugged in.

Under Windows, each wired adapter is assigned a name. The first adapter is labeled `Ethernet`. Additional adapters are identified as `Ethernet2` and up. A new name can be applied if necessary. if and Ethernet settings do need to be configured manually, locate the adapter in Device Manager , right-click and select Properties ,and then update settings using the Advanced tab. You can also access adapter options via the status page in Network & internet settings. 

*Establish a Wireless Network Connection*

To establish a wireless network connection, select the network status icon in the notification area, and select from the list of displayed networks. if the access point is set to broadcast the network name or service set ID (SSID) then the network will appear in the list of available networks. The bars show the strength of the signal, and the lock icon indicates whether the network uses encryption. To connect, select the network, and then enter the required credentials. if you choose Connect automatically option, Windows will use the network without prompting whenever it is in range. 

if SSID broadcast is suppressed, input WLAN settings manually. From the Network and internet page, select WI-FI > Manage known networks > Add a new network. 

WI-FI properties for the adapter are configured via Device Manager. The most important setting on a wireless card is support for the 802.11 standard. Most cars are set to support any standards available. This means that a card that supports 802.11n will also be able to connect to 802.11g and 802.11b networks. You can also adjust parameters such as roaming aggressiveness and transmit power to address connection issues.
