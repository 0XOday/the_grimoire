many print devices come with an integrated Ethernet and/or WI-FI adapter. This means that they can communicate directly on the network. Such a printer can be installed using the Add Printer wizard (from devices and printers) just enter the IP address or hostname of the printer to connect to it. Each computer on the network can connect to this type of printer independently.

Any printer object set up on a Windows host can also be shared so that other network users can access it. This means that the printer can only be accessed when the Windows machine is on. Print jobs and permissions are managed via the Windows host.

A printer is shared on the network via Sharing tab in its Printer Properties dialog. Check Share this printer and enter a descriptive name. Optionally, use the Additional drives button to make drivers available for different client operating systems. For example, if the print sever is Windows 10 64-bit, you can make 32-bit Windows 7 drivers available for other client devices.

To connect to a shared printer, open the server object from Network and the printer will be listed. Right click it and select Connect.
