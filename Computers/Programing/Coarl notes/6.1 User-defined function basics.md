Basics of functions
* A function definition consists of the new function's name and a block of statements/ The function's name can be any valid identifier   
* A function call is invocation of a function's name, causing the function's statements to execute
* a local variable is a var declared in a function 
* A parameter is a function input specified in a function definition. 
- An argument is a value provided to a function's parameter during a function call. 
Returning a value from a function
* A function may return one value by assigning a return variable with the return value


### modular and incremental program development 
* Modular development is the process of dividing a program into separate modules that can be developed and tested separately and then integrated into a single program.
* Incremental development is a process in which a programmer writes and tests a few statements, then writes and tests a small amount more (an incremental amount), and so on.
- A function stub is a function definition whose statements have not yet been written.
