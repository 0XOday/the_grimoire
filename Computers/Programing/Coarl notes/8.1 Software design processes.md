# System development life cycle 

# Steps are as follows 
* Analysis phase : goals, problem to solve  
* Design phase : How to build the program 
* Implementation phase : Write the program 
* Testing phase : meeting goals

# Waterfall versus agile approach 
* Waterfall flows through the development life cycle without coming back to last steps 
* Agile approach goes through the phases repeatedly, each time adding more to the program.
