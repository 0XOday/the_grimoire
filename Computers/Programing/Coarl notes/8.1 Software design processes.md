# System development life cycle 

* Steps are as follows 
	* Analysis phase : goals, problem to solve  
	* Design phase : How to build the program 
	* implementation phase : Write the program 
	* testing phase : meeting goals

* Waterfall versus agile approach 
	* Waterfall flows through the development life cycle without coming back to last steps
