One feature is algorithm time efficiency: The number of calculations required to solve a problem. For the same problem, some algorithms may be much more time efficient than others.
# Types of algorithms 
* Binary search : Considered an efficient algorithm for searching a list.  
* linear search  : 
* Longest common substring: Determines the longest common substring that exists in twp input strings
* Dijkstra"s shortest path : Determines the shortest path from a vertex to vertex in a graph.

# Efficient algorithms and hard problems
