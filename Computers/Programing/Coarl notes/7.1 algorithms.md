One feature is algorithm time efficiency: The number of calculations required to solve a problem. For the same problem, some algorithms may be much more time efficient than others.
# Types of algorithms 
* Binary search : Considered an efficient algorithm for searching a list.  
* linear search  : Iterates over an array of elements and check if the current element is equal to the target.
* Longest common substring: Determines the longest common substring that exists in twp input strings
* Dijkstra"s shortest path : Determines the shortest path from a vertex to vertex in a graph.

# Efficient algorithms and hard problems

* NP-complete problems are a set of problems for which no known effcient algorithm exists.
* A algorithm with polynomial runtime is considered good
	* An ex of one problem is clique decision problem
