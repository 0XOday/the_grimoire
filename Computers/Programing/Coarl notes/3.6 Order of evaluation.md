![[Pasted image 20250605154733.png]]note : Arithmetic operators have higher precedence than equality operators, the logical `and` operator, and the logical `or` operator. Among + and -, evaluation is left-to-right, so + is first, then - is second. Next, the equality and inequality operators have precedence over logical and, so != is third and == is fourth ( left-to-right). Finally, logical and is last.
