To find an area of a triangle.

Area = (1/2) * base * hight


average = (number1 + number2 + number3) / 3. This means you add the three numbers together and then divide the sum by 3

Hi

calculate the pythagorean theorem

temp1 = RaiseToPower(y , 2.0)
temp2 = RaiseToPower(z , 2.0)

x = SquareRoot(temp1 + temp2)

to solve for SquareRoot you find a number that when its multiplied by itself it equals to that number you are solving for.


```

z = RaiseToPower(SquareRoot(y - x), 5)

z = RaiseToPower(x, SquareRoot(y))

z = SquareRoot(RaiseToPower(y, 5) / x)

z = SquareRoot(RaiseToPower(x, 3) - AbsoluteValue(y))
