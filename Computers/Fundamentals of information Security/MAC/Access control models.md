Access Control Models provide frameworks for managing permissions and protecting 
resources within an organization. 

* Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
	* Offers flexibility at the discretion of resource owners, while Mandatory Access Control (MAC) enforces strict policies to protect sensitive information. 

Rule-Based Access Control
* Introduces conditions for access, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) simplifies management by associating permissions with roles.

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
* Provides dynamic access control based on a variety of attributes, enhancing security and flexibility.

* Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is an access control model that allows the owner of 
a resource (such as a file or folder) to determine who can access it and what 
permissions they have. The owner has the discretion to grant or deny access to other 
users.

In DAC, permissions are typically set by the resource owner and can be modified at any 
time. Users can share their access rights with others, creating a flexible yet potentially 
less secure environment. For example, a file owner might grant read or write 
permissions to specific users or groups, while retaining full control over the file.

DAC is useful in environments where collaboration is essential, as it allows resource 
owners to manage access easily. However, it may introduce security risks, as users can 
unintentionally grant access to unauthorized individuals. Organizations often use DAC 
in less sensitive areas where flexibility is prioritized.
