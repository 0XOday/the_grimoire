* Improving existing attacks against the 4-way handshake, making it easier to attack unpatched devices 
* FILS handshake is also vulnerable to key reinstallations.
	* not yet deployed in practice
* how WNM power-save features can be abused to bypass Wi-Fi's official countermeasure against KRACK.
* vulnerabilities related to key reinstallation attacks found vulnerabilities in macOS and iOS that have in the meantime been patched
* the paper explains how WNM power-save features can be abused to trigger reinstallations of the group key, and how the TPK handshake can be manipulated into reinstalling the TPK key. The TPK handshake enables direct connectivity between clients (e.g. between smart TV's and a tablets).
