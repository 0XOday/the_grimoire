* Change management is policies and procedures that reduce the risk of configuration changes 
* ITIL Configuration management model 
	* IT infrastructure Library is a popular documentation of good and best practice for delivering IT services.
		*  - Service assets are things, processes, or people who contribute to the delivery of an IT service.
		- A configuration item (CI) is an asset that requires specific management procedures for it to be used to deliver the service.
		- Configuration baselines are the settings that should be applied to the CI to ensure secure and reliable operation.
		- Performance baselines are metrics for expected performance to provide a basis for comparison for ongoing monitoring of a CI.
- Change Requests 
	- A request happens when there is a fault that needs to be fixed, improve something etc
	- an RFC form is submitted for approval 
		- Purpose of change - what is going to be solved what are the risks of the change vs risk of no change 
		- Scope of change - what is the blast radius of the change  
	* Change Board Approvals 
		* Any big requests will have to have the approval of the CAB ( Change advisory board)
	* Test changes 
	* Figure out how to implement changes to minimize risk 
	* Roll back plans should be in place before any changes are made 
	* End-user Acceptance
