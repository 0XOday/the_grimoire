.bash_profile
export PATH=PATH:~/scripts or whatever
There's quite a bit being assigned to this variable. The following is a breakdown:

- First, the entire value is a command, so it uses the command substitution format, i.e., $(â€¦). This means that the output will be the result of executing the command.
    
- The first subcommand uses df to get drive information.
    
- This is piped to the grep command, which searches the results for anything matching the $vol variable you just defined (in this case, /dev/mapper/vg0-smb).
    
- The awk command extracts the data in the fifth column of these results. If you issue df -h by itself, you can see that the fifth column details the percentage of the storage device that is being used.
    
- Lastly, the cut command simply strips the percent sign (%) from the value so that the script can perform arithmetic on it.
    
- The ultimate result is just a single number that represents the percentage of storage being used by the /dev/vg0/smb volume
```
Shell
echo "Volume storage check run on $(date)"
echo "------------------"
vol=/dev/mapper/vg0-smb
Shell pc=$(df -h | grep $vol | awk '{print $5}' |cut -d '%' -f1)
echo "$vol is $pc% full"
echo "Storage check complete"

```
