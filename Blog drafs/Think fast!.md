How does this make you feel? You wake up on the wooden floor of your childhood room woken up by a storm with water pouring in from the roof pattering into the bucket the filled up three times over last night "At least it was not as bad as the last storm" you think before fully waking up from what you've been calling a good nights sleep if you even call one to two hours of sleep "good" everything aches and creeks as you sit up for a coughing fit that's caused by a broken window letting the autumn air seep into your lungs as you rest hoping to god you don't get a lung infection. You blame no one for this mess you've made or your past self for leaving something that was killing you faster this was just the hand you where dealt with but fuck me how do you play this hand?
