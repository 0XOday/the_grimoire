How does this make you feel? You wake up on the wooden floor of your childhood room woken up by a storm with water pouring in from the roof pattering into the bucket the filled up three times over last night "At least it was not as bad as the last storm" you think before fully waking up from what you've been calling a good nights sleep if you even call one to two hours of sleep "good" . As you sit up everything aches and creeks when you get ready for that coughing fit caused by a broken window letting the autumn air seep into your lungs as you rest hoping to god you don't get a lung infection. You drag exhausted self to the terminal. 

You blame no one for this mess you've made or your past self for leaving something that was killing you faster this was just the hand you where dealt with but fuck me how do you play this hand? 

You don't, at least not by yourself. You play into your strengths that you have and that is will power, passion and the unrelenting need and desire to climb that mountain as long as you can. That mountain being Cyber Security.

Sitting at my plastic desk staring at my laptop screen getting ready for another long day. Whats the plan as I ask myself job applications kill some tryhackme labs and read all relating to IT or subjects supporting it. I do this for a few months. Small improvements but you can only improve so much while in survival mode.

After one of my study sessions you stumble upon this strange blog that you found off of 4chan of all places and decide to check it out. I was immediately hooked it felt like the first time I was reading something at my level of attitude. I should have read the contents as a warning to get out but why the fuck would I quit before I even got started? So I decided to hop on the discord CrankySec.

Everything that was being talked about was talked to depth that I was not on and I not being a good writer I could at least be a good listener in VC. So I did that for hours and hours with people coming and going but one person that stood out was this fucker named TheThirdlegion.   

Her and I had the same schedule at the time so it became extremely easy to be in one company. At first I kept my responses short and sweet they like to describe it as cagey but hey what ever I am fighting for my god damn life here and don't wanna say it just please continue the ninth hour of this info dump session please.
