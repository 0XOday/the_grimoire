How does this make you feel? You wake up on the wooden floor of your childhood room woken up by a storm with water pouring in from the roof pattering into the bucket the filled up three times over last night "At least it was not as bad as the last storm" you think before fully waking up from what you've been calling a good nights sleep if you even call one to two hours of sleep "good" . As you sit up everything aches and creeks when you get ready for that coughing fit caused by a broken window letting the autumn air seep into your lungs as you rest hoping to god you don't get a lung infection. You drag exhausted self to the terminal. 

You blame no one for this mess you've made or your past self for leaving something that was killing you faster this was just the hand you where dealt with but fuck me how do you play this hand? 

You don't, at least not by yourself. You play into your strengths that you have and that is will power, passion and the unrelenting need desire to climb that mountain alone as long as you can. That mountain being Cyber Security.

Sitting at my plastic desk staring at my laptop screen getting ready for another long day. Whats the plan as I ask myself job applications kill some tryhackme labs and read all relating to IT or subjects supporting it. I do this for a few months. Small improvements but you can only improve so much while in survival mode.
