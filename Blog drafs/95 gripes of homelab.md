	Use Rehl elaborate the doc support 

Using NixOS as a server

Not understanding that each tool docker,caddy etc is an abstraction 

Plex cargo cult mentality 

Not clearly explaining the issue at hand

The use of AI for small problems
Insert *that* meme

Yo I got all this HW! Wow what do you do with it?  Insert generic thing here

Not understanding basic networking

What would be a good network appliance. *It depends*   

How do I fan mod *insert thing that should not be fan modded*

The hyper fixation of ECC ram. Your workloads are not that important
