Intro : 





Is this good to buy *insert random hw*? 

I see this question a lot when interacting with the cominuty and I don't like seeing it as it's is extremely vague and doesn't really tell who you are asking the full picture. While its ok to ask for help and opinions is shows the lack of self sufficiency and effort with researching. Its better to have the idea of what you want to do with it or what issue you are trying to solve. My argument is not buying something neat that you want to learn, like a VAX system or *insert random system here* My argument is buying HW that is way to much for your needs. So how do I figure out what I need? *it depends* What do you plan on doing? Do you want a Custom NAS? A media streaming server?  Custom firewall? Or something general? 

When you see individuals with fully populated racks...yes racks you might want to full send it yourself and start grabbing racks for yourself but you do not need that right now. While I understand the vibe and the allure of the blinking lights *B-roll shot of blinky lights :3*. Racks in my opinion are more trouble than they are worth. *B-roll of my racks*  They are a pain in the ass to work around and in and the only time they make sense if have rails for your servers and that you do not have bad knees *insert rice crispy treat sounds* and the space.  

You could go the pretty cheap and easy route by grabbing a small mini PC from ebay. Before you get the idea Raspberry pi's are not at all worth their money. You've just burned about $150 on something that can get blown out by systems that are much cheaper with actual storage that's not a SD card. I understand the hype around them when they first came out and it was   8th gen intel and up are pretty good bets and you can top off memory down the road you should shoot for something with at least 16 giggles of ddr4 ram. The reason why we are going with only 16 gigs of ram is that it keeps cost down and its more common to see listings on Ebay for instead of ddr5 i  .only potential issue is the lack of PCI slots for any expansion but that can be creatively solved with another box or something bigger.  *insert scrolling from ebay cut to throwing something under a desk??* or just using what you have laying around when you first start like a laptop or an older pc *B-roll of a shitbox and laptops*.

When building a system you have to take in account of a few things. Some common pitfalls that I see is that people are ECC memory. The workloads that you will be running will not be that sensitive and right now you should treat that as snake oli!!! *why is this snake oli*. I would argue that the thing you want to splurge on is enterprise SSD's since they can maintain there speed as advertised compared to there consumer counterparts. *shots of Kioxia XG7s, and Intel DC series drives*. 

Half of labbing is making due with what you have and that's ok. The most impressive thing about a lab is *what you are doing with your lab and what you are learning* not just for high fives and showing off.






How do I do X? No I will not read the docs! 

What Distro should I use?
	Use Rehl elaborate the doc support

Insert *that* meme

Yo I got all this HW! Wow what do you do with it?  Insert generic thing here

Not understanding basic networking

What would be a good network appliance. *It depends*   

How do I fan mod *insert thing that should not be fan modded*

The hyper fixation of ECC ram. Your workloads are not that important

Summer hosting. You are not skilled enough to summer host and if you are you will not want to in the first place.   

Not being able to read logs.

SSH servers enabled with password authentication.

Datacenter gear is loud. Get over it.

Do you realize how old that server is?

You don't actually want a Pi

Are you here to learn or LARP?

Logs are love, logs are life

low power draw does not equal efficient.

How can I get a job in IT? DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SIGN UP FOR A COURSE FROM SOME RANDOM GUY ON YOUTUBE.
