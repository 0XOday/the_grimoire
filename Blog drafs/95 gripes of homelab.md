Is this good to buy insert random hw with no purpose 
My argument is not buying something neat that you want to learn, like a VAX system or *insert random system here* My argument is buying HW that is way to much for your needs. So how do I figure out what I need? *it depends* What do you plan on doing? Do you want a Custom NAS? A media server?  Custom firewall? Or something general? 
When building a system you have to take in account age of the parts you are looking at. 8th gen intel and up are pretty good bets  What bottle neck do you want to have and you want to have that as networking. Why networking?

Are you here to learn or LARP?

Logs are love, logs are life

low power draw does not equal efficient.
